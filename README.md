## 📌 About the project :
This project was intentionally built for the DataStax's [Build a modern data app](https://buildamoderndataapp.com/) Hackathon. This project is made for solving social issues while having fun. As there is nothing better than helping each other in this covid times.

## 📌 Briefing of the project :
We have been into these tough situations for now over 2 years. People are restricted to stay at home and socialize less. There have been many cases reported where it is seen that people are suffering through severe mental health issues like stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. People were not ready for such a sudden change in their routine and lifestyle. As the world has changed and many conventional entertainment sources are no more helpful. Here comes our application. Our application is specially targeted to help people overcome the above stated problems. So what does the app do? The app is like a social platform where people can join and the will get few weekly/monthly tasks to be done. Tasks would look something like Planting tree/watering tree/Donating food/Donating blood/Taking vaccination etc. In this way people can help out other people in socity and get entertained as well. After completion of every task the user will receive some points which they can redeem in many ways as they want or if they want they can donate the points to the application where we (team) can convert these points into monitory things (food, clothes) etc or donate it to a NGO. This application is totally target for helping society and it's issues dureing the covid time :)
